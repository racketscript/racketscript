RacketScript is an **experimental** lightweight Racket to JavaScript compiler.
The generated code is ES6, which can be translated to ES5 using
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/). RacketScript aims to leverage both JavaScript and
Racket's ecosystem, and make interoperability between them clean and smooth.

RacketScript takes in Racket source files, uses Racket's macro
expander to
produce
[Fully Expanded Programs](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/syntax-model.html#%28part._fully-expanded%29),
and then compile these fully expanded programs to
JavaScript. RacketScript doesn't support Racket features which are
expensive, for example proper tail calls and continuations.

## Try RacketScript

You can try RacketScript in your browser
at [RacketScript Playground](http://rapture.twistedplane.com:8080/).

## Disclaimer

RacketScript is **work-in-progress** and is not mature and stable.
Several Racket features and libraries are not yet implemeted
(eg. number pyramid, contracts, tail calls, primitives). That said,
we encourage experimentation, user feedback, discussions, bug reports
and pull requests.

## Installation

Following system packages are required -

- [Racket](http://www.racket-lang.org/) 6.4 or higher
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (4.0 or higher) and NPM
- Make

### Quick Install

RacketScript can be installed by running one of the following commands
in your terminal.

For installation via `raco`

```sh
raco pkg install racketscript
```

For installation via `curl`

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishesh/racketscript/master/install.sh)"
```

Or, for installation via `wget`

```sh
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishesh/racketscript/master/install.sh -O -)"
```

See [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) to get started.

### Install from Github

Once RacketScript is cloned in your machine -

1. Fire up your terminal and goto the root directory of the
   repository.
2. Execute `make setup` to install RacketScript compiler and all its
   dependencies.

If you do not wish to pollute your root NPM directory, you can set a
custom global location by changing your `npmrc` (eg.  `echo "prefix =
$HOME/.npm-packages" >> ~/.npmrc`. Then add `/prefix/path/above/bin`
to your `PATH`.

## Basic Usage

RacketScript compiler is named `racks`. 

```sh
racks -h # show help
```
	
To compile a Racket source file:

```sh
# Installs all NPM dependencies and compile file.rkt
racks /path/to/file.rkt
```
	
The above command will create a output build directory named
`js-build`, copy RacketScript runtime, copy other support files,
install NPM dependencies, compile `file.rkt` and its dependencies.

The compiled ES6 modules typically goto one of following three
folders:

- "modules": The normal Racket files.
- "collects": Racket collects source files.
- "links": Other third party packages.
- "dist": Contains sources compiled to ES6 or bundled JavaScript ready
  for distribution.

Here are few other examples that would come in handy:

```sh
# To skip `npm install` step. Useful when building
# for second time.
racks -n /path/to/source.rkt
	
# To beautify assembled modules use `-b`. Make sure
# `js-beautify` is installed from NPM or your
# package manager.
racks -b /path/to/source.rkt

# Override default output directory
racks -d /path/to/output/dir /path/to/source.rkt
	
# Print JavaScript output to stdout
racks --js --js-beautify /path/to/source.rkt

node js-build/modules/source.rkt.js
```
		
By default tail call optimization is turned off. To enable translation
of self recursive tail calls to loop, pass `--enable-self-tail` flag.

```sh
racks --enable-self-tail /path/to/source.rkt
```
### Babel

RacketScript could also use `Babel`. It will compile each assembled ES6
module to ES5, and put it in `dist` directory, persevering original
directory structure. Replace above command with following -

```sh
# Use `--target` or `-t` flag.
racks --target babel /path/to/source.rkt
```

This will compile each ES6 module generated by RacketScript, and put
in `js-build/dist` with same directory structure. The JavaScript
script file produced by Babel in `dist` can be executed directly using
Node. Babel is highly recommended if your target is NodeJS.
